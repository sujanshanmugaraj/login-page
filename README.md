2. **Header Navigation**:
   - Features a fixed header with navigation links and a login button.
   - Stylish hover effects are applied to the navigation links.

3. **Login and Registration Form**:
   - Forms are styled with a modern "glassmorphism" effect, including transparent, blurred backgrounds with glowing borders.
   - Inputs and buttons have responsive designs with hover animations for an interactive feel.

4. **Transitions and Animations**:
   - Smooth transitions for popup visibility, form switching, and hover effects.
